## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
v1.1 decisions:
- Default PayType=Salary, ExemptionStatus=Exempt for existing employees (06-01: NOT NULL DEFAULT in migration)
- String properties with server-side validation arrays for PayType/ExemptionStatus (matching existing Role pattern)
- Hourly=>NonExempt enforcement applied in both Create and Update controller methods
- Frontend defaults match backend defaults (Salary/Exempt) in ManageUsers createUser and AdminUserDetails formData
- Pay Type and Exemption Status placed after Role in AdminUserDetails form grid for logical grouping
- NonExempt displayed as "Non-Exempt" with hyphen in read-only mode for readability

- Shared dateUtils.ts exports getWeekStart, addDays, toDateOnlyString, getDayName, formatWeekLabel for reuse across pages
- Each page independently fetches workWeekStartDay from SystemSettings on mount (no prop-drilling or context)
- OT_THRESHOLD constant (40) defined once at module level, referenced throughout
- Overtime row uses plain text (not input elements) for read-only display
- Amber (#d97706) color for overtime values and exempt warning badge
- Non-exempt weekly total badge uses "X / 40h" format to show threshold
- Exempt warning badge replaces normal badge only when worked > 40, shows neutral message

v1.1 pending decisions:
- Maximum shift duration for missed-punch flagging (research recommends 12 hours)
